This AI model is designed to interpret natural language questions and convert them into SQL queries for a given dataset. It enables you to explore data using plain English without needing to understand SQL syntax or database structure.

The returned SQL will be highlighted in a separate text block allowing you to execute it in one click.
For example:

```sql
SELECT
  'C' AS DUFT,
  'o' AS "is",
  'o' AS very,
  'l' AS cool,
  '!' AS "!";

```
